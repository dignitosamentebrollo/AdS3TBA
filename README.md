# AdS3TBA

Two folders
-M=1 for the case with one excitation
-M=2 for two excitations

In each folder there is a launcher.py where one can set the parameters
and let the run starts.

Every file is widely commentented and the notation is as similar as possible
as the one the paper. For any question, please contact me.
